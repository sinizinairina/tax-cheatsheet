<h1>
Why taxes are so complicated?
</h1>

<p>
To answer that - let's forget for a moment all that we know about taxes and ask financial genius
from the past:
</p>

<blockquote>
The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers
with the least possible amount of hissing.
<br/>
<br/>
-- Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finances of France from 1665 to 1683
</blockquote>

<p>
So, taxes are intentionally designed to be complex to understand and use. To make you lost in the
maze and squeeze the largest amount of money.
</p>

<p>
Let's change this and learn how to be in control and <strong>keep your money safe</strong>.

<strong>Family Home</strong> is exempt from CGT. So if you buy a house for 200$ and later sell it for 300$ youâ€™ll
pay no tax from the 100$ margin.

<strong>Owning assets for 12 months</strong> reduces CGT by 50%. Any assets - home, shares, etc.

<strong>Sell poorly performed assets</strong> to claim Capital Loss and adjust CGT.

<p>
<strong>Delay sale until the end of the financial year</strong>. It would allow to keep the money for the next
12 months. Put it in bank account to earn interests etc.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Balance income with partner</strong> to reduce CGT. For example - transfer shares or saving account, so
the income from the interest rates will go to the lower earning partner.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Work as a Contractor</strong> and reduce CGT by claiming work expenses on rent, car, gasoline, travel,
equipment etc.
</p>

<p>
Work as a Contractor and <strong>spend money on startups</strong> to reduce CGT. Money spent on startup will be
claimed as a loss and reduce CGT.
