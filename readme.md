Why taxes are so complicated?
=============================

To answer that - let's forget for a moment all that we know about taxes and ask financial genius
from the past:

> The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers
> with the least possible amount of hissing.
>
> -- Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finances of France from 1665 to 1683

So, taxes are intentionally designed to be complex to understand and use. To make you lost in the
maze and squeeze the largest amount of money.

Let's change this and learn how to be in control and **keep your money safe**.

**Family Home** is exempt from CGT. So if you buy a house for 200$ and later sell it for 300$ youâ€™ll
pay no tax from the 100$ margin.

**Delay sale until the end of the financial year**. It would allow to keep the money for the next
12 months. Put it in bank account to earn interests etc.

**Balance income with partner** to reduce CGT. For example - transfer shares or saving account, so
the income from the interest rates will go to the lower earning partner.

**Work as a Contractor** and reduce CGT by claiming work expenses on rent, car, gasoline, travel,
equipment etc.

Work as a Contractor and **spend money on startups** to reduce CGT. Money spent on startup will be
claimed as a loss and reduce CGT.
